			<h5>About Us</h5>
			<p>When you have a great story about how your product or service was built to change lives,
				share it. The "About Us" page is a great place for it to live, too. Good stories humanize
				your brand, providing context and meaning for your product. Whatâ€™s more, good stories are
				sticky -- which means people are more likely to connect with them and pass them on.
				Yellow Leaf Hammocks tells users about its product by describing how the hammocks empower
				artisan weavers and their families. The company breaks down different pieces of the story
				into sections that combine words and easily digestible graphics, painting a picture instead
				of big chunks of text.</p>
